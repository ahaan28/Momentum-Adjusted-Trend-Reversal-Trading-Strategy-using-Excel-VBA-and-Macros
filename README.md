This project presents the development and evaluation of a systematic trading strategy using Excel VBA and Macros to automate data handling, trading signal generation, and performance tracking. The strategy is designed to capture momentum-adjusted trend reversals by identifying when market prices become overextended and likely to mean-revert in the short term.

Historical monthly returns from September 2015 to December 2018 were analyzed to backtest the model’s effectiveness. Over this period, the strategy delivered a total return of 25.68% and an average monthly return of 0.64%, with fluctuations showing both profitable runs and notable drawdowns. The project uses Excel’s VBA and Macros to build an interactive dashboard that lets users easily switch between price data, returns, average returns, and visual performance charts.

By fully automating tasks such as shifting between datasets, calculating returns, and updating charts, the project demonstrates how Excel’s native automation capabilities can simplify the development and testing of trading strategies for retail traders and analysts. Users can review past performance, detect trends, and quickly update inputs without manual recalculation.
